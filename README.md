# Text-Analytics

This project was part of my Text Analytics class at Hult Inernational Business School taught by Thomas Kurnicki. Me and my team were tasked with collecting semi-structured text data by surveying our classmates about a fictitious meal-kit delivery app and recording their answers with the speech-to-text function of MS Word.
We then proceeded to analyze the text data and visualize the insights in a Shiny dashboard.
